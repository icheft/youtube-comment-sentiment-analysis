Want more from Mike  He's starting a coding RPG Bootcamp   https   simulator dev,0
I'm 6 days away from turning 73 years old  and I'm learning Python,0
I'm a mechanic learning Python for fun  Love the challenge,1
The longest and most productive YouTube video that I've ever watched  Can't thank you enough for this invaluable Python course for beginners,1
Some Keypoints I noted down  Python   Always typecast your input Default input is always string   List   List can store multiple data types at a time   List Function   f1 extend  f2     adds two lists  f1 insert  index  f1   inserts an elements  f1 remove value    removes the element  f1 pop     removes last element off the list  f1 count value   counter   f1 reverse     reverses the original order of the list  f2 f1 copy     will copy one list to another    Tuple   can t be changed once declared same as list   Use normal brackets not square brackets  ex tuple     4 5       Function   Keyword   def  Example  def ex func     Every function needs to be called in order to be executed     IF  or       and      not    negate   Syntax   if condition1    elif condition2   else      Dictionaries   Can excess certain values by shortcuts or abbreviations   ex dic        Jan     January          Feb     February         print ex dic get   Jan      Invalid            used get   to avoid invalid  inputs    While   Syntax   while condition         For   Syntax   for variable in range  the range for loop          2D List   ex 2D      1 2 3      4 5 6     7 8 9     0     for row in ex 2D       for col in row           print col   OUTPUT    All elements one by one    Comments    anythinginsidethishashtagwillbeacomment     Try except  if user enters a wrong input   Syntax    try       ifanyerroroccurshereexceptwillrun   except typeoferror        statements   Read files   If you open a file  always close it    file open   file txt      r      thiswillreadthefile   print  file readable     readable  willgiveoutabooleanvalue   file close     readlines     will convert each line to an index of an array     Write files   file open   file txt      a      thiswillappend   file open   file txt      w      thiswilloverwrite,0
Great work man  I never understood the concept of coding like how i get it now before this video  I am a B tech Engineering  graduate and wish if I had a teacher like u in my graduation days I would have done 10 times better in my programing class and project works  Thank you once again,1
Excellent demonstration  However  adding real life examples of the uses of these concepts would have taken this video to a whole new level  For instance  where is loop used  Where do we need all the numbers printed out till the loop ends  What kind of organization  service  and format is each of your demonstrated concepts executed in  That remains to be discovered even after watching this video  Nevertheless  can't thank the teacher enough for covering so much of Python in this video,1
Hey  I'd like to thank you so much for this course  I have no knowledge in programming whatsoever  I had 0 experience yet I still learn and understand the more I go through the course  Thank you so much for the course,1
I completed this 4 26 52 hours course and this is longest video I ever watched in my life and thanks for this video it gonna help me a lot in my further python journey,1
I found this course a useful introduction to python  Your way of teaching is very hands on and easy to understand  Thanks,1
You have just mastered explaining the content in a very clear and a convenient way   Thank you so much   The very best video I have come across as a  beginner,1
Thank you SO SO SO much for creating this video  Your examples are amazing  and the order in which you teach these concepts is perfect  I wish I had you as an actual school teacher,1
This was definitely a better way to spend my 4 hours and half  Great job Mike and thanks for being an awesome teacher,1
You are a really good teacher  You have a gift to simplify concepts  explain clearly and show them in a way that facilitates natural learning   I also really enjoyed your simple yet effective examples  they are excellent for learning  and very bespoke to you    It would probably be great if there is part 2 of this video or series to continue the learning journey   Thanks again for the awesome course     much appreciated  Keep up the good work,1
This is the first time I ever said something good about a teacher  we should all deserve a teacher like him in all subjects,1
This was soooo nice  thank you so much  I m completely new to python and this is so easy to follow and understand  You explained everything so in depth and nice  Great tutorial,1
I learnt python from this video last year  I cleared two interviews in python this year and I am in a new job  Thank you smiling face,1

this was really nice,1
I dont see anyone commenting on how you're playing the guitar  upside down   What a truly incredible art,1
This feels like a hug from a friend that you really needed,1
Really good,1
Heaven  Listening her voice in my room  without lights and with earphones  every night,1
This is insane  How has no one commented on the fact that she's playing a right handed guitar left handed  Mad talent,1
Ths is my favorite song to listen to especially when I'm feeling down  You did Mac justice,1
I can listen to this angelic rendition till the end of my days,1
The feeling I get just listening to this cover is just warmth   emotional warmth,1
The absolute ease in which you're playing this song is amazing,1
something to touch your heart and fall in love   after a stressful day or week  Thank you for these wholesome and loveley tunes  3 3,1
I don t ever comment on videos  But this  This  Is the most perfect tune and adaption  Makes me happy even for a brief moment  Thank you,1
Beautiful  sultry voice and an old soul in a such a young vessel   Well done,1
So glad this is now on Spotify,1
One of my favorite songs and covers both  Love the personal touch  you put on it,1
PastaOnMyNeck  damn  sorry to hear that bro  anyway what the people here are saying is that in selfie mode the image gets flipped along the vertical axis  not the horizontal  so even if it were flipped  it wouldnt explain the way the strings are arranged at all,-1
Hey stop messing with  PastaOnMyNeck  he's right  I get his her kind of humor  I send you an ultra big hug wherever you are baby,-1
Like Jimi Hendrix,0
WhiteBread  Most people don t even know of her,-1
PastaOnMyNeck  if it would flip the strings upside down your head would be at the bottom,-1
PastaOnMyNeck  I'm sorry to hear it  you might have not given the easiest path in life but I believe in you to be the best self you can be  You matter,1
just like hendrix himself,0
Lends well to her tone,1
I think its just the video is mirror so everything is reversed,0
how would I know   D,0
why are people impressed if she is playing upside down anyways    thats just the wrong way to play and would only hold you back in guitar,-1
Jos  Luis Fern ndez  HAHAHAHAH,0
Omar Othman  wrong,-1
It was terrible,-1
I don't really like it,-1
It's fake ,-1
"It's horrible, man",-1
"I appreciate the performance, but I don't like the topic actuallly",-1
Jos  Luis Fern ndez  i dont know if u try to share or just make me wrong,-1
Jos  Luis Fern ndez  i should put maybe cuz i'm not saying im full right,-1
Shaurya Giri  Yea but Hendrix still strung his with the heavy E string on top  She's still got hers on the bottom  truly a right handed guitar being played upside down,0
lol there was a big musician that played like that ii cant remember for the life of me who it was  but yeah i noticed  i mean if thats how she taught herself to play from the beginning id  imagine it just feels like normal playing,-1
insane wooow,1
bro thats not talent its hard work,1
She is a witch,1
This brings back a lot of memories  started watching this back in '05 when I was 16  Man  season 1 4 of this show is some of the best tv I've seen,1
there s one thing i don t understand  how does ted remember so many moments in like 5 years of his life that happened like 5 years ago so vividly,0
ted and barney saying  fantasy football  at the same time then looking at each other like that is the ultimate bros got each other's backs moment,1
Lily's loud eating noises might just be the funniest moment in the whole series,1
This is amazing  the editing  the scenes   Thank you for uploading  my good sir,1
The show sucks,-1
4 38  Miracle  I actually always lose it in that scene face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy Also   4 45 Lily saying  hey  Woah  Ahh I don t care  rolling on the floor laughing,0
She is so sad and defenceless    Barney  Does anyone have a condom   face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy,-1
Lying  cheating and selling the odd woman  Yeah I doubt it's exclusive to them,-1
ah shit  here we go again,-1
I am a modern day feminist and I love Barney,1
Well maybe not some aspects but he has great character development,0
Tacolisha Taco   Not exactly what I love but compared to how I hated some of his scenes in the start  he came such a long way,-1
The best part is that the actor who plays him is NPH who is the most wholesome and elaborately elegant gay man who is married with two adorable kids and they have so much classface with tears of joy He s such a good actor,1
Mario Jane I love barney cause he s hilarious but he s not exactly the best person,0
Ginny Weasley  You're not a feminist just because you self proclaim on YouTube videos  Fuck off to Saudi Arabia and go do some real 'feminism' work,-1
face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy,-1
Liam Gallagher     Feminist   f m n st  noun a person who supports feminism   Lmao if you're gonna try make someone look dumb at least make sure your point actually makes fucking sense smh,-1
Liam Gallagher  watched shameless cause there's liam gallagher out there   Be nice btw,-1
so barney is everything,0
Ginny Weasley  SAMAY KI MOD IDHAR BHI AA GAYI   YEH KYA CHAL RAHA HAI,0

Lets be real here in real life a guy like that wouln't have any friends,-1
Why do I feel like this is one of those  I edited the thing so no one will know the original thing face with tears of joy,-1
Liam Gallagher  oh hi there liam gallagher,0
You mean being gay,0

Liam Gallagher  face with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joyface with tears of joy,-1
Yup but he the goat eyes,0
https   youtu be SxhxzXJdLdE How I met your mother in 1 minute,0
Highly doubt even sexist people would like someone with Barney's traits  But overall he is funny and a person with lots of issues  People can relate with his messiness  That's why he is the most popular character in HIMYM,1
Aiden Furry  Just because someone says they are  Feminist   Doesn't mean they have to go to middle east or Africa or other third world countries to prove their stand on it  Feminism can be practiced in everywhere    And if you don't like  Mordern Feminism  than be traditional actual feminist  Saying half assed words in social media will gradually give people the idea that feminism is bad,-1
Fabi  yes he carried the whole show,0
I binge watched the series 3 times and the first time I finished it I cried my heart out,1
Rashi Bajpai  i just finished the series today i feel something heavy leaving it,0

I've watched the whole video without moving a single muscle,0
if there s people struggle  do one part of the routine first  practice it slow  then practice it fast  once you perfect that  go on to the next half and do the same  then you can do the dance all together and it will look amazing  trust me  it really helps,1

The cat in the shower was simply trying to get some private reflection time  face with tears of joy,1
Every world leader should be required to watch at least 1 hour of these adorable animal videos every day  Before long this world will finally have peace,0
That baby seal realizing someone was watching loved it every second,1
I never knew how much I needed to see a parrot petting a puppy until now,0
The  Baby  they were too busy for a Pup Cup  one always gets me laughing,1
This has to be the most cutest moment ever to grace mankind in this difficult period  A kitten and a chic sleeping together,1
This video made me weep  These animals are so cute and innocent  Thank you,1
PSA  As a barista  I will NEVER be upset about getting your baby a pup cup   heart suitpleading face,1
I love it when all the huskys come in and say hello,1

Dude can you make these vertical format,-1
im confused  what happened,-1
teddy   just watch 3 40 loudly crying face,0
These guys didn t pass the vibe check  they are the vibe check,1
anyone else wish they could hear this song for the first time again,0
This track helped me to endure the passing of my mother  and today the passing of my aunt  A big thank you to the both of you  God bless,1
To this day  I still wish I could unhear this song  just to experience hearing it for the first time once again  It pains me to know that can never happen,-1
What a incredible sound  Simply art for our ears,1
The camera man deserves a lot of credit  He caught all the magic and was almost as smooth as the musicians,1
This is a musical masterpiece  for SO many reasons  Its like being at a musical buffet  once you've gotten full  you stop eating   then you come back later on  once the hunger pains start again for a plate of  good listening,1
just heard this for the first time   Ive been making music over 20 years   This is a masterpiece   Beautiful music,1
Purely timeless  That groove is fuckn  nasty,1
Masterpiece  one song that never gets old  You guys should meet again and make more music,1
It's crazy this is 100  improvised  Man this studio session is legendary  not many can pull off a full track improvised  It's out of this world,1
imagine meeting someone who makes you feel the way this song does,0
This song is literally a checkpoint for my lsd trips  It gives me life and keeps me going  Thank you,1
Can t get enough of this song,1
Can't get any smoother than these two talented musicians    Super rhythm and not too unorganized in their instrumental arrangement   hundred pointscheck mark,1
Truly sensational  A different level of talent  vocals and improvisation  Beyond description,1
After listening to this song for a couple of years  I have to make a comment  You guys rule  You are so talented,1
The camera man does not receive enough credit for this  he was bomb  clapping hands medium dark skin tone,-1
This song also found me and what I will say it brought my spirit in line to the goodness of this universe absolutely love it   I listen to everyday now,1
his speech was so fluent like he has prepared for 22 years,0
It's insane this is his only Oscar  literally everyone knows who this man is  he's such a legendary actor,1
Even the other nominees truly doesn't care they haven't won and has a smile throughout his speech  they know how deserving this was and how great Leo is,1
I'm suprised he didn't just get up on stage and go  finally,0
This man s face is literally the reason Hollywood is affluent  His face is pure symbol for cinema and films  Oscar needed him  because he s been an Oscar recipient ever since the Titanic in our heart,1
Man should've atleast bagged atleast 4 5 in my opinion,0
His first Oscar in 6 nominations and he talks about global warming       What a guy,0
kate winslet's face during his speech  she knows leonardo deserves this SO MUCH im crying,-1
I love that guy,1
"Trust me, this was crazy",1
FINALLY wins an oscar and he talks about BIG serious topics  Leo is just the most beautiful and purest man there is,1
he deserves all the Oscars he was nominated in,1
Leonardo doesn t need an Oscar  he is an Oscar,0
He grew beyond the pretty boy type over the years  he's proven that he is worthy to be called a legendary actor,1
Everyone was genuinely happy to see him win  even the other nominees  such a heartwarming moment,1
"Haha, funny!",1
